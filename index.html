    <p><b>B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; (Greater Mt. Ararat), where Noah’s ark came to
        rest:</b> The summit of this awesome volcano is just shy of 17,000 feet, 5150
        meters. At sunset, the Mountain casts its long shadow on the eastern
        border of Turkey where the borders of Turkey, Iran, and Armenia meet.</p>
    

        <h2>Noah's Ark</h2>
        <p><b>Not to beg the question!</b> Suppose someone climbed this Mountain and brought back
        artifacts or samples of old wood from the bottom of a crevasse as proof that he found Noah’s
        Ark. In all actuality, all he would have done is beg the question and demonstrate his
        ignorance of what constitutes valid research and actual archaeological discovery. This is
        because, irrespective of the antiquity of the items that he purported to have found there, the
        items would then not be en site. For that reason, any archaeological significance they might
        have had would be lost. The items or samples could have been carried up the Mountain in
        order to make it appear that they were found there. The actual origin of the samples or
        artifacts would necessarily be suspect. Also, because of the nature of the case, photographic
        and video/film evidence of samples being removed could easily be contrived. Testimonials
        and mere claims simply beg the question. All these things are inconclusive. Removed
        artifacts and samples have archaeological significance only if a prior and proper
        identification of the site from which they are taken has been established; and, even then, only
        if they have been, properly attested, drawn, photographed, coded according to location and
        type, catalogued, and included in the site-log record.

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Paper procedure:</b> In order for such a site and structure to be recognized as a bona fide and
        valid discovery, both the site and the structure designated within it would first have to be
        diagramed in the form of an archaeological site map. The site map (or site-chart) is a
        technical illustration laid out on a metric grid and drawn to scale to within reasonable
        tolerances (as accurately as circumstances, terrain, surface conditions, and accessibility
        permit.) The kind of technical field sketch (or site map) required would have to include the
        following:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <b>
        <li>The position in Latitude/Longitude and altitude</li>
        <li>The shape and proportions of the structure</li>
        <li>Its angular disposition and bearing</li>
        <li>The contiguity of the structure’s perimeter</li>
        </b>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
        <b>Comparison with an ancient literary source:</b> Even after the previously mentioned
        requirements have been independently verified, unless there is a direct correlation between
        what has been thus located, described, and drawn, and what is attested by an ancient literary
        source (as to location, form, proportions, and function), there would yet be no archaeological
        identification of the site. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Collateral Discoveries:</b> It is inconceivable that the discovery of such an enormous ancient
        structure would be isolated. That is, that it would not also include significant collateral
        discoveries, related findings that are either resultant or contemporaneous in nature. These
        would not only be expected at and in the structure, but within both the immediate and the
        general vicinity. They might include debris or detachments from the structure itself,
        inscriptions, and, if not the implements themselves, evidence of the use of implements.
        Evidence of the use of implements consistent with the level of technology exhibited in the
        construction of the structure would be significant. Furthermore, because of successive
        volcanic ash deposits, and because of the acidification of water from micro flora, both on
        and in the ice surface, one should expect to find micro-sites, silicic encapsulations (possibly containing 
        remnants of biological material, or fossilized pollens, if not also seeds and grains.
        There may be exoskeletons and microscopic remnants of various life forms). Also, core
        samples of down-slop layered scree, ash and debris deposits, gravel soils, and moraine
        material in the general vicinity would have to be analyzed.
    </p>

    <h2 id="announcement" class="anchor">Announcement of Discovery</h2>
    <p>
        <b>This announcement,</b> together with the Project von Bora Discovery Technical sketch, the
        general outline, and the comments that follow, does not beg the question. Furthermore, the
        presence of the ancient structure on B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; 
        (Greater Mt. Ararat), as thus depicted and
        positioned in Latitude/Longitude and altitude, has been independently verified.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the following outline and comments point out, according to the ancient literary source, the
        ark is first to be identified by the nature of its construction, its rectilinear box shape, its
        proportions, and its location. In view of its enormity, the simplicity of its form, and its
        placement in high, glacial terrain, the independent confirmation of its discovery would best be
        accomplished (<b>and has been accomplished</b>) by means of high resolution aerial and satellite
        photography and radar imaging. The capabilities of civilian satellite imaging (now including that
        of radar imaging) are adequate to confirm the discovery, i.e. if the 0.68 to 0.5 m. res. images are
        not suppressed.

            In the summer melt of 2000, the structure
            began to emerge above surface (IKONOS
            satellite image of 18 August 2000), and, by
            mid September 2000, the entire length of the
            structure emerged above the ice surface
            (IKONOS satellite image of 13 Sept. 2000,

            of the 9/13/00 image that Project von Bora
            desired to purchase, IKONOS would not
            release it. Nevertheless, a SPOT satellite
            image …1371A/2, of 2003 confirmed the
            location, size and bearing of the structure.

            Such a massive, ancient, manmade, rectilinear structure with a discernible
            shadow is <b>not classified</b>. It is not permissible for any legitimate government
            administration, department, ministry, or agency either to refuse to acknowledge
            or to suppress the knowledge of the presence and location of such a structure
            after the notice of its discovery has been
            posted.

    <h3>Explanation, Personal Account, and Comments by Edward Emerson Crawford </h3>

    <p>
    The presentation of the <b>discovery</b> took place in December of 2006. Two full size, signed, and
    framed reproductions of the technical sketch were presented in person: the first presentation was
    to the Government of the Republic of Turkey at the Turkish Embassy in Washington DC on
    December 14th, 2006; and the second presentation was to UNESCO World Heritage on
    December 15th, 2006, at United Nations Plaza, New York. The reason for the second
    presentation is because the Government of the Republic of Turkey has chosen to work in
    cooperation with UNESCO World Heritage with regard to world heritage sites in Turkey. And,
    of all discoveries and sites, this is <b>The World Heritage Site</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>The following is a summary of the methodology that led to this verified discovery:<br>
        (Additional personal history and other background information is included for continuity.)
    </h3>

    <p><b>A. THE ANCIENT LITERARY SOURCE</b>: The First Book of Moses, Genesis, is the one
        ancient literary source of sufficient specificity to establish both the identification and the
        location of the site (<b>A, 1</b> through <b>4</b> below pertain to identification, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> to location): 
    </p>

    <p style="padding-left: 50px; border: 3px solid gainsboro">
        <b>Insertion: The first of several personal and background comments:</b> It was my approach to
        the interpretation of the text, a grammatical/historical literal hermeneutic, that gave rise to this
        endeavor. After completing initial studies in Hebrew and Koiné Greek at Highland College in
        Pasadena, California (1966 to 1970), my hermeneutic was further honed at the Theological
        Hall, 356 Raven-hill Road in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from 1970 to 1973. In the process of
        comparing idioms and other forms of expression in the original languages, I carefully
        considered the account of Noah and the flood. As I did this, it became obvious to me that one
        of the reasons, if not the primary reason, why certain details were included in the Genesis
        record in the way that they were was because by them the ark was intended to be located and
        identified. I not only perceived the perspicuity and sufficiency of the text; I realized that a
        once-and-for-all location and identification of the ark was to be accomplished by this means.
        (Later in this outline I will explain how I knew from the text both the location of the vessel
        and the primary means of identification.) From the moment that this dawned on me, I was also
        aware that I had embarked on an appointed and therefore relentless pursuit: and, because
        appointed, the outcome was forgone. It was not a matter of finding the ark; but, rather, it was
        matter of proving that by the text I had found it. I am well aware that the intensity of my
        interest in exegesis and hermeneutics is not of my own instigation. It had nothing to do with
        any inclination or propensity that was either latent in me or at all desired by my natural self.
        Nor could I take the least credit for the successful outcome of this endeavor. <b>This is an
        acknowledgment of gracious providence.</b>
        <br><br>
        <b>“To whom much is given, much shall be required.”</b> I am fully cognizant that the act of
        placing the ark where it is and the act of locating it in the way that I have been enabled to do
        are both aspects of one event in one reality. In that it has been thus exposed, let this event be
        a sign for all mankind, and let the message occasioned by it be “a savor of life unto life and
        of death unto death.”
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>1. The Word Translated ARK:</b> The descriptive word for the vessel that Noah was instructed to
        build (Genesis, Chapter 6) is <i>TEVAH</i> (Egyptian, <b>t-b-t</b>, Arabic and Turkish, <i>TAB&Umacr;T</i> ), which
        literally means box, but with the connotation of <b>coffin</b>. When people or animals are placed in
        such a box/container, the word necessarily means coffin. The same word occurs in Exodus,
        Chapter 2, verse 3. In that instance, it was in outward compliance with a royal edict demanding
        infanticide that the child Moses was placed in such an ark, a coffin made of papyrus reeds. That
        little coffin was dubbed with both slime and zaphet (pitch), and then set afloat in the waters of
        the Nile. While the same word denotes coffin in both instances, it is not the word for a
        sarcophagus or mummy case; nor does the word denote any form of ossuary. Any of the latter
        would be an <i>AR&Omacr;N</i>, just as Joseph’s bones were placed in an <i>AR&Omacr;N</i>. (Genesis, Chapter 50,
        verse 26).
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>2. The Proportions of the Ark: What is a cubit?</b> Among the ancients, there are some
        conspicuous commonalities with regard to measurement and the word <i>am ah</i> (cubit). The word
        is from <i>amam</i>, Assyrian <i>am&amacr;mu</i>, hence <i>ummu</i>, womb, maid servant, maiden, <b>mother</b>. In the
        Indo-European languages the dominant word for <i>to measure</i> is <i>meter, &mu;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&#941;&omega; </i> (to measure, to
        estimate, to apportion, to pass over) from <i>ma/matér</i>, <b>mother</b>. So also the word <i>am/am ah</i> (by
        its consonantal origins) is from womb <i>maid/mother</i> (hence, to measure as in day/month periods
        (L <i>mensura,mensus,menstruus</i>) Assyrian <i>ummu</i>, with <i>ammatu</i>, and Aramaic <i>am a</i> (for cubit). In
        Indo-European generally and Sanskrit, <i>pa/pat</i>, father (Greek &pi;&alpha;&tau;&eta;&rho;, patér) denotes
        provider/protector, while mother, <i>ma/mat</i> (Greek <i>&mu;&#942;&tau;&eta;&rho;</i>, G <i>Mutter</i>), is the measurer, the one who
        spans, accounts, and apportions. Mother and predominantly the feminine gender, apparently for
        that reason, came to pertain to things that are linear in concepts, whether apportioned, accounted,
        or reckoned as expanses. So, in Indo-European and Indo-Germanic, feinine (weiblich) came to
        be applied to <i> &fnof; &eta; o&delta;o&sigmaf; </i> (the road, the way, the street) and <i> &fnof; &eta; &epsilon;&rho;&eta;&mu;o&sigmaf; </i> 
        (the wilderness), as L <i>&fnof; via</i>,  LL <i>&fnof; strada</i> 
        so it is G <i>die Bahn/die Strasse</i>, and <i>die Wüste</i> (from OL <i>&fnof; vesta</i>). Intuitively,
        these were recognized as feminine, irrespective of noun origin or declension.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The length of the <i>am ah</i> cubit (<i>the mother portion or the mother-measure</i>) varied.</b>
        Irrespective of what length of body portion and/or body-limb span may have applied (whether
        the addition of the span of the hand be added to the length of forearm and hand or the entire
        length be doubled), the length of the cubit was whatever the unit of linear measure happened to
        be in a particular realm and/or during a given era. Other than to observe that the length of the
        cubit tended to shorten when a dominant ethnic group or dynastic kingdom was eclipsed by
        another, there was no hard and fast rule. The length of the Hebrew <i>am ah</i> at the time of the
        construction of the tabernacle and until the captivity of Judah and the Davidic dynasty was
        consistently a little over seventeen inches. (This approximation is consistent with the length of
        Hezekiah’s water tunnel from the Spring of Geh!n to the Pool of Siloam, cf. Hezekiah’s tunnel
        inscription.) Ezekiel speaks of a change in the temple cubit, a hand breadth being added to the
        length of forearm and hand. (I finally realized that to assume that any of these should be equated
        with the ancient Noaic cubit was ill-founded.) 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The Ark of Noah is described as a rectangular box/coffin 300 <i>amah</i> in length, 50 <i>amah</i> in
        width, and 30 <i>amah</i> in height</b> (Genesis 6: 15). However, with no prior or set criterion for
        determining the length of the antediluvian (or Noaic) <i>amah</i>, the only thing for certain about the
        proportions of the ark is that its length-to-width-ratio is <i>six to one</i> and its length-to-height-ratio
        is <i>ten to one</i>. This appears to be consistent with the findings (see Discovery Tech-sketch).
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3. The materials:</b> The ark was to be constructed of gopher wood (probably a pitch-bearing
        wood) and covered inside and out with <i>kaphar</i>. While the word <i>kaphar</i> is translated <i>asphalt</i> in
        the Septuagint, the word itself means <i>to cover</i> and even <i>to atone</i>. The word <i>masha<u>ch</u></i>, <i>to smear</i>,
        <i>to anoint</i>, or <i>to apply as paint</i>, does not occur with regard to the material applied to the surfaces
        of the ark. The act of coating and the coating material itself are expressed by the same word
        simply as the application of a separate component. While <i>na<u>ch</u>ash</i> denotes any alloy that
        includes copper and tin (bronze), <i>kaphar</i> may well be the ancient word for copper. Hence, the
        name of the isle of Cyprus (where we derive the word cuprous and apply the place name Cyprus
        tree). Copper was mined on that island from the most ancient of times. Yet, the word <i>to overlay</i>
        (as in to overlay with metal) is not used with regard to <i>kaphar</i> in Genesis, Chapter 6. It is
        conceivable that some mixture including cuprous oxide and/or malachite was used to coat the
        ark. In an effort to account for this use of the word and the idea of <i>atonement</i>, some have even
        speculated that the coating material itself my have included a votive and atoning component.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>4. Particulars of the plan:</b> According to the given specifications, the ark was to be constructed
        with an upper covering or roof over a main deck or level, with two lower levels or decks
        beneath the main deck. A door was to be set in the side of the ark that opened, not only to the
        main level or deck, but simultaneously to the lower second and the third decks. One cubit down
        from the very top of the structure was to be a vent opening, “in a cubit shalt thou complete it
        above” (Genesis 6:16). <i>Qinim</i> (nests) were to be made in the ark. This would be consistent with
        the idea that the animals were to be in a coffin-like, hibernating, or suspended animation state.
        Once again, the idea of coffin and a type of death (a death to the old world and a resurrection in
        the new) may apply.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>5. The <i>Situs (The Place where the Structure Rests)</i>:</b> Determining the location (<i>situs</i>) of the ark
        involved an analytical and critical examination, not only of the text itself, but of the geography
        specified in the text. The word <i>situs</i> refers to a location, but not simply to where something is:
        more particularly, it refers to that location as a vantage point from where a certain observation
        can be made. The uniqueness of the observation determines the <i>situs</i>. The following two verses
        furnish a literary description of the <i>situs</i> of the ark: 
    <p>
    <p style="padding-left: 50px;">
        <b>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon
        the mountains of Ararat. And the waters receded continually until the tenth month.
        In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains
        seen. (Genesis 8:4 and 5).</b>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px; color: darkred">
        In order to commemorate the exodus from Egypt, Nisan, which had been recognized as
        the seventh month in the yearly cycle, was from then on to be regarded by the people of
        the Exodus as the first month of the year, Exodus 12:2.
        </p>
    </p>
    <p>
        According to Genesis, the waters of the flood began to recede after 150 days, and the ark finally
        came to rest on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the month Nisan. (Perhaps
        not merely a coincidence, the first day of the week after the regular weekly Sabbath in the midst
        of the Pascal week, the day of the feast of First Fruits and the &omicron;&psi;&delta;/&delta;&pi;&iota;&phi;&omega;&sigma;&kappa;&omega; moment of
        resurrection arrived as the sun approached the horizon on the evening of the Seventeenth day of
        Nisan.) Yet, it was not until the first day of the tenth month that the tops of other mountains
        (plural) came into view. That is, when the mountains appeared on the horizon above the curved
        surface of the receding water. Whether an observed horizon on the curved surface of the earth,
        or mountain tops emerging above the water surface and coming into view over that horizon, or
        even the appearance of a rainbow, each of these is coincidental ocular phenomena that
        presupposes and is contingent upon a given <i>situs</i>. To depict an observable horizon at sea is to
        project a point (a <i>situs</i>) at a given distance above the surface of the sphere of the earth and from
        that point to inscribe a circle whose radius is the tangent from the surface of the sphere to that
        elevated <i>situs</i> point. The diagram below is a cross-sectional curvature-of-the-earth line-of-sight
        graph that illustrates what the language of Genesis 8: 4-5 describes:
    </p>
    <div id="cross-section">
    <img src="./assets/vonbora_cross_diagram.png" alt="A cross-sectional diagram of flood water">
    <p style="color:brown;">
        In this cross-sectional diagram, if one were to look from the <span style="color:red"><i>situs</i></span>, the depth of the <span style="color:blue">water</span> on the curved earth’s
        surface would not permit the mountain tops on the left to appear on the horizon. On the other hand, if the depth of
        the water were to decrease, the tops of the two taller mountains on the left would appear on the horizon.
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        When this pertinent principle of spherical geometry is born in mind, any careful examination of
        the topography of the ancient mountainous region known as Urartu (or Ararat) will reveal that in
        that entire region there is but one place, one relatively small area, where the <i>situs</i> of the ark
        could be. That <i>situs</i> had to be high in the glacial snowcap on the north face of B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;.
        From there, the first mountain tops (plural) that would have emerged above the curved surface
        of the water to appear on the horizon would have been the tops of two A&gbreve;res mountains in
        Armenia, north of B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;. Just as the Genesis account intimates, from that <i>situs</i> those
        two summits would have come into view almost simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>6. A process of further elimination:</b> While the geographic description furnished in the ancient
        text narrowed the parameters of possibility significantly, a subsequent and more specific
        examination of the topography of the upper north face of the Mountain narrowed those
        parameters even further. There is a relatively small portion of the upper north face of the
        mountain that could provide an adequate platform for such a massive structure. If an area was
        too steep, or if it was either a scour or a crush zone, or if it was simply too unstable to be an
        adequate load-bearing surface, that area was eliminated as a prospective site. Mt. Ararat is a
        collapsed-cone composite volcano. All the slide, scour, and crush zones that surround the
        summit eliminate that entire vicinity of the Mountain. Some areas at first considered to be
        possible sites, after exposed in recent extreme melts, turned out to be either bare rock or too 
        unstable. Other areas of the Mountain were obviously formed by fairly recent volcanic activity,
        far too recent to be a platform for the ark. After determining all the places where the structure
        could not be, just about the only place left was a relatively small area between the flows of
        Parrot and Abich I glaciers.

    <p>
        <b>7. The first satellite image of the Ararat region was obtained back in the 1970s:</b>
        A Landsat satellite image of the Mountain bearing an exposure date of 13 July 1973 was
        obtained from NASA’s Sioux Falls Landsat facility. It proved to be exceedingly significant.

        <b>Insertion: Personal history, a background in photo surveillance and topography:</b>
        From as far back as the time when I attended High School in Walla Walla, Washington, and
        participated in the School’s Army ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Corps), I was introduced
        to military map reading and aerial reconnaissance photo analysis. That is when I learned to
        plot elevations and draw curvature-of-the-earth line-of-sight graphs. I remember the map and
        photo that first captured my interest. It was a military map, scale 1:25000, of Gettysburg,
        Pennsylvania, with an aerial photograph of the same Gettysburg area on the map’s reverse
        side. I had been to Gettysburg and seen firsthand certain features and structures that were
        recognizable in the aerial photograph. My early appreciation for aerial photo analysis was
        encouraged by the Army Officer in Charge of the ROTC Detachment and by two very
        capable, regular Army sergeant instructors. 
        <br><br>
        Also, during the three month summer breaks between the High School’s Spring and Fall
        semesters, I was employed by Washington State University, Horticulture Department, in
        Pullman, Washington. There, I took advantage of an opportunity to examine aerial
        photographs and to compare my findings with my own subsequent on-the-ground
        observations.
        <br><br>
        Upon graduating from high school, I enlisted in the U.S. Army and volunteered for missile
        defense duty in the Baltimore/Washington DC metropolitan area. However, after basic
        training, instead of being sent to a missile line battery for training, I was kept at headquarters,
        Fort George G. Meade, Maryland, to make use of my skills as a draftsman and illustrator.
        After the Cuban Missile Crisis, that headquarters unit was phased out, and I was sent to
        Germany. In the course of my work over the next two and a half years as a
        draftsman/illustrator for the Army in Europe, my experience with aerial photographs and
        cartography was useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Thus, I was acquainted with aerial photo surveillance and various target detection
        techniques</b> long before I obtained the 13 July 1973 Landsat satellite image of the A!rı Da!ı and
        the Ararat region. One such technique takes advantage of snow or heavy frost when it begins to
        melt. Manmade objects are usually geometric and/or symmetric in shape. When precipitation
        and temperature conditions are right, such objects can often be easily distinguished. This is
        because manmade objects tend to retain, radiate, and dissipate heat at rates different from those
        of their natural surroundings. As surface temperatures rise from below freezing to just above
        freezing, whether because of the immediate radiant energy of the sun or some other warming
        condition, manmade objects that might otherwise be well camouflaged and indistinguishable
        from their surroundings often become visible and eminently identifiable. For, where snow or
        heavy frost crystals linger, as opposed to where they do not, a momentary but distinct telltale
        pattern appears. That pattern is the object’s <i>freeze-thaw thermal signature</i>. Even though the
        temperature differ-ences between a manmade object and its surroundings may be extremely
        subtle, one degree Celsius or even less in many cases, when surface temperatures fluctuate at or
        above the freeze/thaw point that difference is all that is necessary. Whether the object’s thermal pattern appears
        as a negative or a positive, the distinct contrast differentiation is comparable to that achieved by
        advanced and sophisticated image enhancement technologies
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>I have described this technique because I found such a freeze/thaw negative in the Landsat
        satellite image.</b> On the morning of July 13, 1973, in those areas of the Mountain where there
        was no cloud shadow, the sun’s radiant heat had begun to warm the surface and melt the
        remnants of a recent light snowfall. At the photo moment, the snow had nearly vanished from
        one end of a rectangular object, but had remained on the natural terrain adjacent to and
        surrounding that end of the rectangular object. It was an object that might otherwise have been
        indistinguishable from the terrain around it. Just enough fresh snow remained to define one end
        of a 90&deg; cornered structure:

            The dark structure seen in this
            Landsat image is the same 90&deg;
            cornered structure that I later
            designated with a marker of
            discovery during the climb of
            1990. Its entire length (about 350
            meters) is discernible in the
            IKONOS and SPOT satellite
            images.

       <p>
            <b>Insertion: A brief account of the events that led up to the climb of 1983:</b>
            In Ankara, Turkey, in April of 1982, I met with the Turkish Government’s Information General,
            Mr. Kaya Toperi. (Later, the same Mr. Kaya Toperi served as Press Secretary and personal
            assistant to both the President and the Prime Minister of Turkey and also as the Ambassador to
            Switzerland.) In the process of describing to him the kinds of things that an archaeological field
            techs does, I told him of my particular interest in paleography. I knew that insufficient attention
            had been given to inscriptions there and that the older inscriptions (some of which had been at
            least partially described to me by people from the mountain) were key to the archaeology of the
            entire area. My brief presentation and explanation was favorably received.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later the same day I related what had transpired in the meeting with Mr. Toperi to Howard
            Carlson, a teacher and field archaeologist with considerable experience in the Middle East. As we
            assessed what was said, Howard Carlson and I suddenly realized that the research permit I was
            seeking was now, more than likely, well on its way. Therefore, without delay, I contacted John
            Morris, the son of Henry Morris, to prepare and to finance an expedition for 1983.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first thing that John Morris wanted to know was who among his colleagues would vouch for
            my integrity and capabilities. I immediately thought of Robert Kofahl, a PhD from Cal. Tech. and
            a former Carter Research Chemist who had been the President of the little college where I studied
            Greek and Hebrew in Pasadena, California. He had not only been my teacher, but a long-time
            friend. When I mentioned his name, John said, “You know Bob Kofahl?” After he talked to Dr.
            Kofahl, the necessary funds were committed. Preparations for an expedition were underway.
        </p>
        <p>
            John Morris and I went to Ankara in March of 1983 to make sure that we had done everything
            possible to secure the permit. It was then that I made a brief presentation at the Turkish Historical
            Institute to explain my approach to research on A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;. Prof. Dr. Ekrem Akurgal wrote out and 
            signed his endorsement of my proposal as soon as I finished my brief presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            In August, 1983, I was granted a first-of-its-kind, comprehensive, technical research permit to
            take a team up A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;. The team was to make a general survey with particular regard to
            ancient inscriptions on the Mountain. Of course, if there was a possibility that inscriptions were
            present on an ancient structure, that too would have fallen within our officially granted purview.
            Having waited in Washington D.C. for more than two weeks for papers, the team finally
            assembled in Ankara. There, we waded through skeins of red tape and bureaucratic snarl-ups. We
            went from A&gbreve;r&inodot; to Aralik. From there we were sent for more red tape in Kars and suffered a car
            wreck on the way. I was hauled into court, but was defended by a Turkish Army Sergeant (Kotek
            Detatchment). Then we went back round the Mountain to Do&gbreve;ubayazit.

    <h2 id="climb83" class="anchor">The climb of 1983 and its findings:</h2>
    <p>
        In the first week of September, the team, together with a small contingent of local
        Kurdish camp assistants and horsemen, with pack horses and donkeys in the entourage,
        started out from Örtülü, an old village at the foot of the Mountain. Our assigned guide
        was a congenial and capable fellow, Ahmet of Kaiseri, and our own Turkish liaison and
        guide was Ahmet Ali Arslan, a PhD and former teacher at Atatürk University. In his
        youth, he had been a mountain guide for Fernand Nevara. One of our group, Don Barber,
        had to turn back after the first day up the mountain because of a problem with an old
        knee injury.
    </p>
    <p>
        After arduous and thirsty climbing
        and one unscheduled bivouac
        because of thick ice fog, the group,
        including John Morris, Brian Bartlett
        (technical climbing specialist), and
        me, finally arrived at the foot of
        Parrot Glacier to set up base camp:

        The following morning, we went on a fact-finding
        day-pack excursion in the Ahora Gorge (Cehinnem
        Dere).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I immediately recognized certain very early
            forms of pictographic proto-Sumerian word
            grams. I saw that these were distinctly linear
            and arranged syntactically from right to left.
            Although, at first, I did not recognize the
            word grams on the left side of the
            inscription. Nor did I perceive all the
            implication of tool signature mark until
            later.

        <b>Insertion: A reciprocal arrangement regarding the protection of the inscriptions:</b>
        These inscriptions are of inestimable importance to the whole of mankind. Only after the
        Turkish Deputy Minister of Culture in Charge of Monuments, Museums, and
        Archaeological Excavations, assured me in 1993 that I would be allowed to go to the
        Mountain and designate these inscriptions and that the inscriptions would then be
        protected by the appropriate Turkish authorities did I agreed to publish the discovery of
        the Ahora Covenant Inscription. The Deputy Minister said that the matters for which I
        had applied would not proceed and that no permission would be granted unless “a notice
        of discovery was published in an internationally recognized scientific publication”. In
        compliance, I published the notice of the discovery of these proto-Sumerian pictograms
        and specifically the Ahora Covenant Inscription in <i><b>Research & Exploration</b>, a Scholarly
        Publication of the National Geographic Society</i>, Autumn 1994 issue. 
        <br><br>
        However, after I had published the discovery, rather than honoring their agreement, an
        effort was made on the part some in the Turkish Ministry of Culture, and also on the part
        of other influential Turkish officials, to decry the discovery. However, it not just that the
        Sumerology and Paleo-graphy consultants for National Geographic thought that my
        assessment had merit: it was the Sumerologist of the Turkish Ministry of Culture, Veysel
        Donbaz, Sumerologist for the Archaeological Museums of Istanbul, who defended my
        notice of discovery. When Veysel Donbaz was asked by the Turkish Government’s
        Department of Bilateral Cultural Affairs to submit a report on what I had published in
        <i>National Geographic’s <b>Research & Exploration</b></i>, he pointed out that my assessment of
        the proto-Sumerian pictograms had been correct. And, later, he said that I had given “a
        reasonable, good translation of the inscription” (<i>The News Tribune</i>).

            <b>The significance of this form of
            inscription on A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;:</b>
            These pictographic word signs appear
            to be older than the oldest
            Mesopotamian proto-Sumerian, in that
            they exhibit a lesser degree of
            stylization and are neither rigidly
            stratified nor compartmentally
            organized. This find is a major
            breakthrough in Archaeology,
            Paleography, and Linguistics. But, it is
            particularly the discovery of the <b>Ahora
            Covenant Inscription</b>, the sequence of
            whose pictograms is strikingly similar
            to essential elements of the Noaic
            Covenant (Genesis, Chapters 8 and 9),
            that puts the archaeological approach to
            the Mountain and to the entire subject
            on an altogether different footing.

            <b>2. Exploration of ancient cave shelters:</b>
            That same day, we climbed up a steep scree slope to explore four manmade cave
            shelters. In these cave shelters I found proto-Sumerian word grams inscribed on
            stones that protruded from the sides and the uneven floor of the shelters. The
            inscriptions are of the same type and size as those found in the gorge below.
            It is quite possible that I
            located the spot near
            the opening of one of
            the cave shelters from
            where one of the
            inscription stones found
            far below in the gorge
            dislodged and tumbled.
            As I examined a stone
            at the cave’s mouth, I
            saw that the shape of
            the one side of that
            stone would have joined
            well with the stone
            found below. And, in
            the immediate
            proximity, I also found
            part of a pictogram. It
            was because of both of
            these finds that I
            thought this to be a
            distinct possibility.

        <b>Brian Bartlett took
            this photo of me as I
            stood in the back of
            the same cave shelter
            and pointed at a
            proto-Sumerian
            pictogram (<i>Dingir,</i>
            for deity). </b>
            At least the antiquity of
            the cave shelters was
            established (1) by the
            inscriptions in them,
            and (2) by their
            continuity with the
            inscriptions found in
            the gorge below.

    </div>
    <p>
        In the lower photograph, I am examining that stone at the back of the cave shelter. It
        was evident that the angled upper face of the stone had undergone some surface
        preparation and smoothing in conjunction with the inscribing of the ancient protoSumerian pictogram upon it.
        <br><br>
        The earliest writing forms found in ancient Sumer indicate a fully developed system
        of primal ideograms. Yet, there is no adequate evidence of developmental precursors for
        these ideograms in Sumer/Mesopotamia. This would tend to support the view that the
        writing system was brought there after having been developed elsewhere. The discovery
        of the A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; ideograms would tend to support this view.

            <b>Insertion: Discussion concerning the July 13, 1973 Landsat satellite image:</b>
            On the day after these discoveries, while I was making a second attempt to enter a fifth
            cave shelter, John Morris and Ahmet Ali Arslan climbed up the side of Parrot Glacier to
            examine a possible site of the Ark. John had told me that he was well aware of the same
            Landsat image that I had obtained and had seen the object in it. He said that that site had
            been thoroughly examined and that there was nothing there. I had the audacity to ask him
            about it again while we were on the Mountain. He insisted that what he had said before
            was indeed the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did not believe that I was either mistaken about the Genesis account (8:4-5) and the lineof-sight-graph as the approach to determining the <i>situs</i> in relation to the topography of
            the area. The rectangular object in the Landsat image fit all too well with my earlier
            surmisings. Furthermore, the place where the object appears in that July 13, 1973, satellite
            slide seemed to be just about the only place where the glaciation of the Mountain would
            allow such a structure to exist. Even if John Morris himself or others had indeed been to
            that site and examined that area, the lingering question in my mind was if they actually
            knew what to look for once they were there?” Nevertheless, I bit my lip and said nothing
            more because our time on the Mountain in 1983 had run out.
        </p>
        <p>
            That afternoon we broke camp, descended to a prearranged rendezvous with the men who
            were bringing up the pack horses. Then we rushed off the mountain and met up with Don
            Barber. Arrangements were made for the team to assemble in Ankara before going our
            various ways.

        <b>Additional comment concerning the Ahora Covenant Inscription:</b> I had been very
        slow to perceive and even slower to convince myself of the proto-Sumerian word signs,
        their sequence and syntax. Even after I recognized nearly all of the signs, simply to
        interpret each one individually according to its primary meaning and then to read them
        from right to left in the direction indicated by du [gin, gub] (the foot sign) [with construct
        genitives as preceding signs], all seemed far too simple and straight forward. Although, I
        knew this approach to be consistent with the earlier and primitive use of the signs. I
        finally said to myself: “If inscribed in stone for posterity, why would it not to be just that
        simple and straight forward?” Perhaps with this latter consideration in mind, I was able to
        translate it with at least a reasonable degree of satisfaction.

        <p>
            As mentioned earlier, <b>the Ahora Covenant Inscription bears a tool signature
            mark</b>, the mark of the person who put the inscription on the stone so many millennia
            ago. The mark (in the white square on the left) consists of two upward fivecentimeter-wide chisel cuts, each at a 45&deg; angle (making a 90&deg; V shape) and a 2.5-
            centimeter-wide chisel cut downward into the vertex, also a scriber tool mark, up and
            to the left. The sharp, straight and flat cutting edge of a chisel five centimeters in
            width left small parallel lines as it planed off certain parts of the stone where the
            pictograms were afterwards inscribed. Also, the accuracy and straightness of the tool
            signature mark testifies to the hardness and the quality of the implements employed.
            It appears to be a signature mark more befitting a precise artisan and engineer than
            just that of a scribe. (I expect to be able to return and point out where else the same
            signature mark occurs.)

        <h3>Insertion: Comments concerning the
            circumstances that led up to the climb of
            1987:</h3>
            <p>
                As in this snap shot of Greater and Lesser Mt.
                Ararat taken from the NASA Space Shuttle, the
                melt can be extreme and the snowcap small.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1986, I was in Washington D.C. talking to
                Ahmet Ali Arslan at Voice of America. We
                stopped by the Arslan’s personal office and
                apartment in Virginia afterwards.
            </p>
            <p>
                There, framed and hanging on a wall, was a remarkable photograph of Büyük A!rı Da!ı
                that Ahmet had taken during a time of extreme melt. I commented to him on how small
                the snowcap was at the time he took that photo. As I looked at the photo carefully, I
                noticed that the pattern of the remaining ice was very similar to the pattern of the
                snowcap’s perimeter in the July 13, 1973, Landsat satellite image. It was as if Ahmet’s
                photo of the Mountain had been taken later that same summer. And, if that was so, 1973
                was likely a year when the structure would have emerged above the ice surface. I
                suddenly had a desire to reexamine that Landsat color slide in earnest. With the
                ramifications of the findings of the 1983 climb and Ahmet Ali Arslan’s photo on my
                mind, on 16 December 1986, I pulled out the original Landsat satellite slide and then
                looked around for a certain little stubby printer’s microscope given to me by James
                McKenzie, the Project’s patient printer. When I found it, I reexamined every microscopic
                morsel of emulsion in the pertinent area of that linear satellite image. I went over it line by
                line, first horizontally and then perpendicularly. The angle of the parallel sides of that
                ninety degree cornered object in relation to the linear and horizontal nature of the satellite
                image meant that the object could be nothing other than a manmade structure protruding
                out of the icy surface of the Mountain. 
            </p>
            <p>
                My eye glanced from the magnifier’s lens over to my wristwatch. Even though it was now
                one o’clock in the morning on the Seventeenth of December, I telephoned Clifford Brown
                and told him what I had found. Then I told him that the reason I had called him was
                because I needed a man who would climb the mountain with me to do the next phase of
                the work, a man who would not give up, no matter what. I said that I needed a man who
                could also drive a car with well refined skills, and a man who would be unflappable and
                never show the least emotion when dealing with government officials. I said that he
                needn’t commit himself at that moment because I would see him later on that morning. He
                said that he did not have to wait because he knew that he was fully committed as I spoke.
            </p>
            <p>
                I applied to the Turkish Embassy in Washington D.C. and requested to make an eight day
                expedition in July, 1987. However, July went by and there was no reply. I assumed that
                permission had not been granted. Then, on 29 August 1987, there was a letter from the
                Turkish Embassy. It said that the permit had been issued. We were to obtain our research
                visa’s and proceed to Ankara to get our final papers. Also, in Ankara, we were to contact
                our assigned alpinist guide, Gem Kurt. If he was not able to go with us, we were to find
                the alternate guide, Ziya Mengenecio&gbreve;lu, in Erzurum. We were to be at the foot of 
                A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;, and ready to climb on 9 September 1987. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Shortly before our flight to Turkey, I received a telephone call from Col. James Erwin,
                the astronaut who had walked on the moon (Apollo Program). He also climbed Büyük
                A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; more than once in his own Ark quest endeavors. (For, according to him, the
                discovery of the ark would be the more important event for the good of mankind.) He told
                me that he had expended a lot of effort and resources to get a technical research permit
                for that year. He congratulated me on obtaining it and gave me a full briefing on all that
                was going on in Turkey that would affect our efforts. He wanted us to know what to 
                expect in the process of getting up the mountain to do our research. He assured me that he
                would keep us in his prayers. I thanked him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In Ankara, we were at first told that there was no record of our permit. Then we were
                detained because we had supposedly violated security restrictions. These were just tests.
                We passed. Then we located Gem Kurt. He was very helpful; but, because he had taken a
                new job at a bank, he could not go with us to the Mountain. We would have to find Ziya
                Mengenecio!lu in Erzurum and bring him to the Mountain. After sorting through the
                usual bureaucratic snags in Ankara, we headed east for Erzurum in a rented Turkish Fiat
                station wagon. We drove through the night and straight into a blizzard on a high mountain
                pass. Suddenly the right rear tire blew out. Changing it took a little extra effort in the
                wind and snow. The heater never worked, and we couldn’t shut off the cold air coming
                through the vent in the dash. We stuffed wet tissues in the louvered vent to try to keep
                from freezing, but they wouldn’t stay in. So, the next morning when we met Ziya
                Mengenecio!lu we were a bit weary and disheveled, if not still shivering.
            </p>
            <p>
                That night, Clifford Brown and I met with Ziya Mengenecio&gbreve;lu and his friend, Professor
                Dr. Ziya Yurtta&scedil; of Atatürk University. Over supper at Hotel Sepher, we explained our
                Project. After Prof. Yurtta&scedil;’s made favorable comments concerning us, Ziya
                Mengenecio&gbreve;lu was willing to stick his neck out for us and for our worthy endeavor. The
                next day we were on our way to Do&gbreve;ubayazit, the city just south of the Mountain near the
                Iranian border. 
            </p>
            <p>
                That evening, Ziya Mengenecio&gbreve;lu took our papers to check in at the police/security
                barracks in Do&gbreve;ubayazit. He was utterly amazed at the terms of the technical research
                permit that had been granted to me. He kept asking me, “Who are you? Who are you
                really?”
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>What’s in a name?</b> Not long after that, Ziya recognized who I am at least well
                enough to put his own label on me. That is, he gave me my Turkish Alpinist
                Federation nickname: “Yava&scedil; Yava&scedil;”. The name stuck. It means Slowly-Slowly. I
                am not sure whether the name has to do with the pace of my climbing, or the speed
                with which I contemplate things and come to conclusions. For some odd reason, Ziya
                repeated that nickname continually, even in pleading tones, when he was in the
                passenger seat and I was driving the car. I doubt if I drove any differently than Cliff
                Brown, but Cliff didn’t drive too close to the cliffs. He just got called <i>Chliff</i>. That is
                how Cliff is pronounced in Turkish. B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; is the Turkish name for the
                Mountain, but, to Ziya Mengenecio	&gbreve;lu, B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; is not an it but a she. He says
                she is his wife. He has always loved her. Although, he has never had any illusions
                about her peculiar personality. Though usually sedate with her head in the clouds, at
                the drop of a hat she can become stormy, temperamental and downright ruthless.
                Right on the border, she is definitely a borderline personality. In Turkish, 
                B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; means big pain.

        On the following morning, as we were making our ascent up the talus slopes of the
        Mountain, we had to stop at predetermined locations and at set times in order for Ziya to
        report in by walky-talky radio to the local military/security forces. At all times, we were
        to be within line-of-sight low-power FM radio range. I am sure that we were under

        Once we arrived at high base camp (about 14,200 feet, 4320 meters) the wind started to
        pick up. If Cliff and I had not built a snow and rock wall to shield at least the lower part
        of our Sears and Roebuck dome tent, in all likelihood, both it and we would have been
        blown down the mountain. At 2:00 a.m. we laced and strapped our gear on and headed for
        the summit, climbing by the light of our little lithium flashlights. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Just before dawn, as we were climbing up the rocks at about 15,400 feet, I looked down at
        my shoulder strap. Something about it didn’t feel right. I swung it round to check it. Lo
        and behold, I had only one crampon. How could that be? I remembered leaning into the
        gusting wind next to the flapping and popping tent in the night’s pitch blackness, lacing
        crampons and miscellaneous camera gear onto my back strap. I had inadvertently laced
        one crampon on twice instead of two crampons on once. Fingers were a little too cold and
        numb to feel what they were doing. One crampon had obviously dropped into the snow at
        the side of the tent. Because of the noise of the wind, I probably couldn’t have heard the
        jingly crampon hit the snow. When I realized what had happened, I threw down my ice ax
        in disgust and sat down. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Ziya turned back and said, “What is problem?”
        <br>
        “I’ve only one crampon!” I replied.
        <br>
        With the dawn reflecting in his eyes, Ziya glared at me and said, “Is no problem. You! Move!”
    </p>
    <p>
        In the process of climbing to the summit with just the one crampon, I kept looking for
        places that were a little bit softer so that I could stomp in with my spikeless boot and not
        slip. Not far from the summit, I stomped through the hardened crust, right into a hidden
        crevasse. The left leg went in just up over the hip. My leg swung back and forth under the
        thin crust, but bumped into nothing. By spreading out both arms and the leg that hadn’t
        gone through, and by keeping both body and ice ax handle flat, I made every effort to
        keep from dropping out of sight. Otherwise, there would be no coming back, not from that
        trip. My carcass would have been there for the duration of this present evil age. (I
        wouldn’t be surprised if that crevasse were fifty or even a hundred meters deep.) Very
        gingerly, I rolled, pulled my leg out, and slowly stood up. I raised my hands in a gesture
        of giving thanks. With a big sigh, we all turned our faces toward the summit and kept
        going.

        summit, the wind was gusting between 40 and
        80 kilometers, and it was cold, 30 degrees or
        more below zero Celsius. But, it was clear.
        Down below us there was a thin layer of
        cirrostratus clouds. They fanned out like a
        translucent flat surface on a transparent ocean.
        The tops of the two taller mountains to the

        I had seen fresh bear footprints on the Mountain in 1983; but, in 1987 I was surprised to
        find really large bear prints in the snow right on the summit. I know of a fellow, a hunter,
        who had a little bit of a territorial dispute with one of the Mountain’s bears. The fellow
        shot the bear, but the only cart-ridges he had were full metal jacketed military ball
        ammunition. His shots killed the bear, but not quickly enough. The bear, after being shot
        several times, still killed the hunter before it died. The brother of the hunter had shared a
        tent with me on the Mountain in 1983. I relate this because, whether it be bears, sheep
        dogs, wolves, or people, everything that resides and survives on that Mountain seems
        somehow to disguise the fact that it is far tougher, far more strong willed, and far more
        vigorous than outsiders generally suspect or even imagine.

                The angle of this photo furnishes a view from the south
                side looking northward over the summit and across the
                upper west end of the great Cehennem Dere (Ahora

                northeast.
            </p>
                While on the summit, I looked northward and slightly
                westward across the upper end of the great Gorge in the
                direction of the east end of both the upper and lower
                plateaus. I focused my view in the direction of the site of
                the ancient structure. I knew then that I had no false
                image. So, how did the structure get there? No one, no
                number of men, could ever have built it there.

            <b>Insertion: Continuation of the immediate comment concerning the origin of the
            structure:</b> Even if someone could obtain and hew a wood beam of sufficient length,
            girth, strength, and mass to equal one of the thousands of beams necessary for the
            structural composition of the ark, no one has yet devised the means either to transport or
            to place such a beam on the site. No one could move and or maneuver such a beam there
            in order to build anything with it. The huge rectilinear structure is situated at an altitude
            of 4,500 meters (14,765 feet). Though stationary, the state of its angular disposition is not
            one of horizontal equilibrium. There, it could never have been level. The entirety of the
            rectilinear mass rests along the crest of a sloping and slumping ridge in the relatively
            narrow margin between two massive and dynamic glaciers. The glaciers flow in opposite
            directions. To suggest that such a structure had to have been (or even could have been)
            constructed there in ancient times by some form of human effort and contrivance is
            beyond absurdity. Such a feat would not only eclipse all of the ancient wonders of the
            world combined, it would involve the combined resources, the transport of materiel, and
            a degree of logistics that would consume the efforts and output of myriads of people for
            eons. The infrastructure and collateral constructions necessary for transport and
            construction would be a hundred, if not a thousand, times more extensive than the
            structure itself. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To assume that such a thing could be built at that altitude, on an intermittently active and
            notoriously unstable volcano, in the most radical of weather conditions and subzero
            temperatures, amidst dynamic and ever changing glaciers is to defy rationality.
            Furthermore, it would have to have been done for no apparent and no actual human
            necessity. For the ancients to build such an unrivaled structure only to be obscured by ice
            and made inaccessible, to be seen by no one except in the most freakish of conditions,
            this would be to accomplish the most unprecedented feat only to have it be useless. But,
            could such a thing also be accomplished in secret? What is perhaps even the more
            devastating to such a notion is that the building of it in that location would have to have
            been done in the proximity of ancient and literate peoples without a shred of extant
            written record of the construction anywhere, without even the slightest allusion to its
            construction there in the anecdotal tradition of any civilization or ethnic group. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On the other hand, both the literary and anecdotal tradition of a world-wide flood and of
            the members of a certain family, together with pairs of all land animals, having been
            preserved in such a great vessel, is universal among ancient peoples and civilizations the
            world over.

            <b>The matter is <i>a posteriori.</i></b> The Books of Moses are themselves an effect, an effect that
            testifies to its ultimate and adequate cause. The literary work does this in the most
            straight-forward of terms, in the very clearest words that language can express. Only what
            that literary source specifies concerning the shape, the relative proportions, and the means
            by which the structure came to be at that location coincides with the findings on the
            Mountain.

            <b>The summit is a vantage point like none other</b>; not simply because from there one
            can see across the expanse of Turkey’s eastern frontier and right into Iran and
            Armenia, even into part of Azerbaijan; but the summit is that special vantage point
            because, if one is acutely aware of moment, place, and providence, he can view the
            caldron of the earth from the epicenter of its stirring storms. If he sees a faint and
            distant rainbow, he can perceive a pur-chased time to breathe the air. (It’s only
            because of the savor of a sacrifice accepted that there is this temporary respite from
            wrath due unto an execrated earth.) If he views the old lady Büyük A!rı as the
            slumbering giant that she is, if he stands atop her hoary head, he can look down over
            her brow, over her shoulders and bosom. How immodest she is! It’s an experience
            unique in time and space! To be there, high above her pillow-lava form, is not just
            figuratively to stand at the center of it all. For, if the entire expanse of the world’s
            landmass is computed, there is a sleeping volcano at its center, at the place officially
            known as Landmass Centrum. That volcano is Büyük
            A&gbreve;r&inodot; (Greater Mt. Ararat). To
            gaze from the top of her collapsed-cone crater-crown is to contemplate Pangæa
            reassembled and to be at the one point from which all earth’s features and creatures
            have spread out. Where in time? With regard to the appointed time for fallen
            mankind, to look from there is simultaneously to see both <i>beginning of era</i> and <i>end
            of era</i>. Just a cold, windswept peek? No, she’s a pinnacle of sublime meditation.

    <h3>Comments concering the preparations for the climb of 1990:</h3>
    <p>
        In the end of 1987, as clifford Brown and I drove back from the Mountain to Ankara,
        we assessed many of the things that had transpired. We recognized that our approach
        had been correct. Right then Project von Bora took on a renewed impetus. We knew
        that the next application to be filled with the Turkish Government would have to
        define more specifically the area on the Mountain where the structure rests. The
        letter to accompany the application would have to implore that a permit be granted
        for both that location and the location of the inscriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1988 and 1989, I was able to make arrangements with a film and funding agent.
        His part was conditional on my obtaining the necessary technical research permit.
        The permit would not only have to allow for full archaeological research in the areas
        of the Mountain that I had specified, but would have to contain provisions for a
        complete video/film of the expedition and its findings. In order to fulfill my end of
        the arrangement with the agent, I would have to go to Turkey ahead of time in the
        summer of 1990. That is, I would have to go before the time of the expedition to
        secure the permit and all the required paper work. When and if all this was
        accomplished, I was to notify the agent. Funds were then to be provided and the
        agent himself was to come to Turkey with his equipment and ready to proceed to the
        Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>   
        In 1990, I did get there ahead of time. The necessary permits, including all of the
        provisions that I had asked for, were granted. It was all set for late August and
        September of 1990, but not without considerable help from some courageous people
        in Turkey and an intrepid hand studious compatriot, Ken Olson. With that help, I
        was enabled to fulfill all my end of the arrangement. However, when I contacted the
        film and funding agent, he used the impending conflict in Kuwait and Iraq as an
        excuse, then cowered out and told me the the financial support was withdrawn. As far
        as he was concerned, I too should just abort and go home. I told him that one did not
        do that to the Turks who’d stuck their necks out. With permit in hand, I’d make my
        best effort or die trying.
    </p>
    <p>   
        Between the time when the permit was granted and the date when the expedition was
        to begin, Ken Olson endured a course called Traveling with Crawford, at his
        expense. I should perhaps mention some of the incidents that happened along the
        way. Just for being with me, Ken too was arrested in Selcuk. Literally under the
        gun, we were fingerprinted seven times and conducted across the town square under
        guard to a photo store. Ken paid for both our mug shots. We were charged with
        “Possessing unlawful equipment and Engaged in unlawful research”, the latter
        carried a mandatory sentence of five years in Turkish Federal Prison. However, the
        judge called the archaeologists of the Ephesus Museum into court. They vouched for
        me. The judge dismissed the charges and threw the whole thing out. Then, after
        some white-knuckle driving to and through Istanbul, we flew to Pakistan. There, out
        of my archaeological and paleographic interests, I wanted to browse around the ruins
        of Taxila longer. However, how to deal with the depravity of this present evil age
        took precedence. From Rawalpindi-Islamabad, we went north up the Grand Trunk
        Road and then over to Peshawar. From there, we took an excursion up towards
        Khyber Pass and next to the Afghanistan border. Some locals went out of their way
        to make Ken feel unwelcome around those parts. Later, when it was time to go back
        to Turkey, we boarded out flight at Islamabad airport. The PIA Boeing 747 had
        technical problems in flight. It managed to land back in Lahore, Pakistan. After
        some imperfect fix, we took off again, but turned back south and landed in Karachi.
        That would be the long way to Istanbul, but we took a look at the Indian Ocean’s
        Arabian Sea. Next, we were herded into another overloaded 747. As soon as it lifted
        off, it blew two engines, crashed back down into the far end of the runway and slid
        off sort of sideways into the rough. We sat there in that broken plane with 400
        disgruntled people and their crying children sor six or seven hours. The plane’s
        available facilities were far more than maxed out. Finally, we were conveyed over to
        another PIA 747. The third flight was a charm. From the air we saw Mt. Ararat. We
        arrived in Istanbul in one piece, but a day late and a dollar short.
    </p>
    <p>  
        <b>Project rescue:</b> Ken by now was coming down with some illness. He was physically
        unable to go with me to the Mountain. So, leaving me in Turkey, he returned home
        to Smyrna, Delaware, to recuperate. So, I was all alone in Istanbul, broke, and
        without the necessary gear and resources. Nevertheless, I was still obligated to climb
        the Mountain and to do everything that I could to complete the primary mission. I
        was finally able to get a telephone call through to Dr. Cliff Brown. At the time, he
        was serving in the US Army Medical Corps in Germany. He told me to rent a car on
        a card (a credit card that I had been afraid to use) and to be at the airport in Ankara
        to meet him. After he had been up all night as OD (officer of the day), he took an
        emergency leave and caught the only available flight from Frankfurt to Ankara. It
        was somewhat worse for ware Green Air Russian tri-jet. To make up for some gear
        that I was lacking, Clifford had borrowed a couple of sleeping bags and some
        camping gear from Army Special Services.
    </p>
    <p>    
       
        I met him as soon as the plane landed in Ankara at 4 o’clock in the morning. The
        two of us now constituted one barebones, weary, rag-tag excuse for an expedition,
        but we were thankful, enthusiastic, and ready. From Ankara, we drove straight
        through to Do&gbreve;ubayazit by the northern route. With Cliff at the wheel, it was more
        like flying low in a well tuned Renault five speed. If that car’s engine had any
        residual carbon deposits, they were soon blown out and eradicated. that same day, in
        the evening, we could see the Mountain silhouetted against a cobalt sky. In
        Do&gbreve;ubayazit, we first located our primary guide, only to find out that he would not
        be able to climb with us, then we encountered an Alpinist Federation Guide by the
        name of Hussein &Ccedil;oktin. He was ready and raring to go. By the next evening, we
        were already up the Mountain and taking a welcome snooze at low base camp.
    </p>
    <h2 id="climb90" class="anchor">To Walk on the Ice Above the Structure, The Climb of 1990:</h2>
    <p>
        The next morning we began our ascent to high base camp. There would be little time to
        rest there. From high base, just before midnight, we started out for the summit, climbing
        by flashlight. At first we climbed together with an Austrian group, but they were just
        going to the summit. As usual, I was slow. Hussein complained about my wearing heavy
        boots at low attitude, thinking that they were slowing me down. If I had told him that it
        was because of my sprained ankle and that I wouldn’t have been able to climb without
        them, he would have sent me back right then. As it was, I was coughing my insides out. It
        was bronchitis. I picked it up in Pakistan. The coughing was sapping my strength. Hussein
        shined his flashlight at me and saw that my face was gunmetal gray, like walking death. He
        said, “We will send somebody with you, and you can go back.”
    <p>
        “No!” I answered, and I immediately turned my face away to pray.
        <br>
        A very pessimistic “Uh!” came out of Hussein &Ccedil;oktin’s mouth.
    </p> 
    <p>  
        But, right then, a verse thundered through my whole being: “Call upon Me and I will
        answer thee and show thee great and <u>hidden inaccessible</u> things that thou knowest not.”
        So, I did. ( See Jeremiah 33:3, cf. original language.) As I turned back to look into
        Hussein’s eyes, he shined his flashlight in my face again. This time, my face was ruddy,
        vigorous, and full of life. At that instant, in the clearest, loudest voice, I said, “Let’s go!
        Let’s get going!”
        <br>
        “Oh! Uh! Okay!” Hussein said. He had probably never seen such a transformation

        <b>Insertion: Comment concerning another technique in aerial photo surveillance
        and target detection:</b> Perfectly straight and parallel fracture lines and/or rectilinear
        fractures or slumps do not occur naturally in a moving and weathering ice surfaces.
        When such straight and perfectly parallel fractures reoccur in the same place after
        other features have changed over time, those reoccurring straight fractures are
        invariably caused by a manmade structure usually immediately under the ice or
        snow surface.

    </p>
    <p>
        We climbed right up past the summit and down the north slope towards the designated site
        where the structure rests. All three of us were roped up. Cliff took the lead. (The lightest
        man, if he falls through into a crevasse, is the easiest to pull back out.) We were all poking
        in with our ice ax handles, probing to test the deceptive icy crust. 

    </p>
    <p>
        Before descending down towards the site from the Mountain’s lower plateau, I waited in
        meditation and intense supplication. Eyes nearly frozen shut, I was determined to stay right
        there until I could reopen my eyes, orient, and see exactly where the structure rests. In my
        hand, I held an enlargement of the July 13, 1973, Landsat image. With eyes now wide
        open, I carefully compared the satellite image, feature for feature, with what I could now
        see clearly on the Mountain. Finally, everything aligned. I could plainly see the location of
        the structure.

            shadow.

        <b>2. A venting crevasse:</b> After I saw that the two straight and parallel fracture crevasses lined
        up perfectly with both sides of the structure in the enlarged satellite slide, I noticed that the
        straight fracture crevasse on the right was venting out a rush of expanding air. The only
        reason I could see this was because the escaping air was immediately expanding and
        therefore cooling. The water vapor in it was momentarily freezing. The resulting tiny ice
        crystals in that air were reflecting the morning sun. It was no volcanic steam vent.
        Obviously, in conjunction with the structurally perfect, straight, and parallel fracture
        crevasses, there had to be an exceedingly large cavity just under the translucent surface.
        The enormous quantity of escaping and expanding air had to have previously cooled and
        contracted in that cavity. Furthermore the cavity had to be very close to the surface in order
        for the air in it to be sufficiently warmed by the intense radiant heat of that morning’s sun.
        (I found no other crevasse or opening on the mountain that was visibly venting.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>3. Observations at the site gave rise to an immediate plan of action:</b> I wanted to do
        some ice-screw anchor and rope work in order to get down into that venting crevasse. Also,
        with my ice ax, I was chipping away at a spot where, within a very few inches of the
        surface, there was what appeared to be a dark gray, exceedingly long, perfectly straight,
        right-angle-edged beam. The object was still iced over, but the ice was somewhat
        transparent because melting had taken place immediately over that portion of the long,
        straight, dark gray object where I was chipping. I wanted to continue to chip there because
        I expected to expose at least a small portion of the very long, massive and straight object.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I turned round to tell Hussein Çoktin what I intended to do, before I could explain,
        he pointed to some ice storm clouds that already started to rise up from the gorge to the east
        and from the bottom of the Parrot Glacier to the west. Then he pointed to Cliff Brown who
        had exposed a little too much skin to the radiant sun at that altitude. I agreed with Hussein
        Çoktin that we would have to go back to high base camp and come again in the morning to
        do the things that had to be done there
    </p>
    <p style="border: 3px solid black; ">
        A marker of discovery: At 10:00 a.m. on the 28th of August, 1990, I left my marker of
        discovery at the site. It is 40 centimeter piece of black ABS plastic pipe with gaskets and
        screw caps on both ends. Inside, there are glass test tubes with a black plastic screw cap on
        each one.
    </p>
    <p>
        After we had climbed back up past the summit and down the south face to high base camp,
        it was then that Hussein Çoktin told us that he had another group coming for whom he was
        to serve as alpinist guide. He informed us that we would have to climb off the Mountain
        right then. So, he reneged on his standing obligation to us. All he was going to do was
        conduct us down the Mountain and make sure that we had a jeep ride back to Do!ubayazit.
        I informed him that we had dealt with him in good faith and fulfilled everything he had
        required of us. When I told him that he had misled us and had no right to break his
        agreement with us, he went over and spoke with an armed Turkish soldier who was there
        on duty at high base camp. When he came back, he said that, if need be, he would have the
        Turkish Army conduct us off the Mountain. I told him that that would hardly be necessary,
        but I made it clear that Dr. Brown was in no condition right then to climb down the
        Mountain. I explained that all Cliff needed was to sip some liquids and get a good night’s
        sleep in the tent that he had already crawled into to rest. I said, “After that, he’ll be fine and
        ready to go! But, apart from that, nobody is going to make him climb anywhere, not up hill,
        not down.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Hussein Çoktin immediately had other ideas. There was no lack of determination in him.
        Some-how, he got a horse all the way up to high base camp. He made sure that Cliff was
        perched on its slightly slantwise saddle. After I had gone on ahead on the path down the
        Mountain, Hussein, with firm grip on bit and bridle, led horse and rider all the way down to
        the low camp.
    </p>
    <p>   
        From there, we both got a lift, a ride in an old Russian version of a jeep. It was a long,
        rough, jarring, clatter-rattle ride back to Do!ubayazit, but it sure beat walking. As we
        bumped along, I had time to think over the whole journey. I hadn’t gotten all I expected;
        certainly not all I wanted; but, apparently, it was all I needed. I realized that what was
        accomplished would change the world. Despite all obstacles, we had climbed over the top
        of the Mountain and down the other side, all the way to the site. Overruling providence had
        put my eyes right there and enabled me to see and compare satellite image with what was
        on-the-surface and also compare line-of-sight chart with the view from the situs itself. But
        why couldn’t we go back in the morning? Hussein Çoktin saw me leave my marker of
        discovery at that site. I remembered the look on his face. Then I remembered that as we
        approached the site, I had shown him the terms of the permit in the Governments
        radiogram. I had thought he was frightened because he did not know that we had
        permission to be on that part of the Mountain. We did. But, when he saw the paper, he
        became more afraid. I think he realized right then that this was no idle venture. I was no
        like anyone else he had dealt with on that Mountain. He knew that I knew what I was doing
        and what it meant. He was frightened anyway, and now I was sure of what had frightened
        him off.
    </p>
    <p>   
        I did know. While some would perceive it as an olive leaf and a dove of peace in a
        rainbow mist of mercy, to others it would be a storm cloud and portent of impending
        judgment, I knew that the site where I left my marker would prove to be the most important
        archaeological discovery of our time. The accomplishment of 28 August 1990 at that
        location on the north slope of B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot;
         is irrevocable, an appointed reality neither
        to be hidden, nor ignored. Getting precise coordinates and measurements was just a matter
        of time, though a far longer time than I imagined then.
    </p>
    <p>   
        What a day! We had passed the summit twice, once going and once on the way back. We
        had completed the whole climb in twenty four hours. No cakewalk, but not a bad day’s
        work! If ever there was a good work “before ordained that we should walk in it”, this was
        one. Special thanks has to be given to the faithful supporters of Project von Bora. Also,
        along the way in 1990, it was first Ken Olson and then the determined Clifford Brown who
        had come through in the pinch and laid the neck on the line to give all so that these things
        could be accomplished.

        <b>The empirical evidence is manifold and <i>en site</i>,</b> from macro to micro, from major survey to
        electron microscopy and molecular analysis. On the basis of what is shown in the Discovery

        taken place. In that the altitude, the Lat/Long position, the rectilinear shape and proportions,
        and the bearing of the structure are adequately set forth and drawn to within acceptable

        included the Lat/Long and the altitude and also the enlargement of the July 13, 1973 satellite

    <h2 id="implications" class="anchor">Implications of the Discovery</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Administrations and agencies of the United States Government have been informed
        and have verified my discovery of the ancient structure on Ararat:</b> In October of
        1999, on the Air Force Base at Ankara, I was asked by Major General Robert Boots,
        USAF, ODC at the time, and by Major General Phil Nuber, USAF rtd., then employed by
        Boeing, to report to them and to the group that was with them about the discoveries and
        work of Project von Bora. General Nuber, a former ODC in Ankara, had been in charge
        of satellite imagery, aerial reconnaissance, and surveillance photography and mapping for
        the US Military when I first announced my discovery of the structure at the designated
        site on the Mountain. That morning, I first reported to them the direct correlation between
        the structure on the Mountain and the 90&deg; cornered structure in the July 13, 1973, Landsat
        satellite image (an enlargement of which had been on the vonbora.org website since
        1995). I then explained how I knew that the ancient structure had emerged to or above the
        melting ice surface in 1998. At that point, General Nuber spoke up, acknowledging
        everything that I had reported. He told everyone there that, though he had not had the
        opportunity to meet me until that day, everything that I reported had been over his desk.
        He laughed when I said that I had found it far easier to fine the ark than to get a decent
        map of the Mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
        Afterwards, General Boots and his wife invited me to lunch at the Ankara Hilton. It was
        then that General Boots impressed upon me that I was to proceed immediately with my
        application to the Turkish Government and to pursue my research endeavor on B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot;
         without delay. He informed me that, because the Ambassador was away, I was to
        meet instead with the Chief of Station, Eugene Christie, at the US Embassy. He told me
        that I was to report the same things to him that I had included in my presentation to them
        that morning. Furthermore, whatever was necessary to fit it into my prearranged schedule,
        I was to meet with the Chief of Station at the Embassy before leaving Turkey.
    </p>
    <p>
        When I met with Mr. Eugene Christie at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara and gave my report,
        he said that he could not promise to do everything for me that the Reagan Administration
        had done, but that he would do what he could. He also said that, once the outcome of my
        work on the Mountain was known, I would have to acknowledge with gratitude the
        assistance of the Generals [Phil Nuber and Robert Boots]. Mr. Christie’s report
        concerning the matter and concerning my meeting with the Generals and others went to
        the White House during the final months of the William Clinton Administration. I would
        find out the ramifications of that later.
    </p>
    <p style="border: 3px solid purple; ">
        More than a year and a half later, it was Ann Weldon of USIS (United States Information
        Service) at the U.S. Embassy in Ankara who told me that it was because of what Mr.
        Christie had come back with and required that she could not even be caught giving me
        the public telephone number of the Turkish Department of Bilateral Cultural Affairs. That
        being the case, what Mr. Eugene Christie and whoever instructed him were up to is
        totally unwarranted, an abuse of government office, deliberate obstruction, even to the
        most absurd and irrational degree. Did he think that I (and the Generals also) had not told
        him the truth? What was his and/or the State Department’s agenda?
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Generals retain honor:</b> At the time that I first announced the discovery, if there was
        anyone whose job it was to know whether my analysis of the July 13, 1973, satellite
        image was correct, that person was Major General Phil Nuber. Also, after I had climbed
        to the designated site on the Mountain, General Nuber was the one person who would
        have known whether I had interpreted the surface observations and findings correctly.
        That is, whether I had actually established the presence of the rectilinear structure at that
        site by comparing those findings with the satellite image. Not only did he acknowledge
        that I had correctly designated the site of the structure, he also later proofread and
        approved my letter to General Edip Ba&scedil;er. That letter informed General Ba&scedil;er and the
        Turkish General Staff of the discovery site and of my research on Büyük
        A&gbreve;r&inodot;.
    </p>
    <p>   
        No adequate, portable GPS had either been available or allowed at the time of the climb
        of 1990. Nor had we a theodolite, back-reflector, or range finder. We were not afforded
        the opportunity to measure with a tape or even to pace things off. General Nuber, because
        he knew that I needed access to a better Lat/Long and measurement capability, gave me a
        contact and tried to help me obtain a GPS keyed aerial photograph of the site. (Despite
        best efforts, that request did not seem to work out. So, I have had to wait these so many
        years until more adequate Lat/Long positioning and remote measuring capabilities came
        into public domain.)
    </p>
    <p>   
        Before General Nuber passed away, he was contacted by a reporter for The News Tribune,
        a Mr. William Hutchens of Tacoma, Washington. In speaking with Mr. Hutchens, General
        Nuber not only confirmed that he had had that meeting with me (and also with General
        Boots and others) on that Sunday morning at Ankara Air Force Base in October of 1999,
        but General Nuber also confirmed to the reporter that I had indeed designated the
        rectilinear structure on Büyük
        A&gbreve;r&inodot; that appears in the 13 July 1973 Landsat satellite
        slide.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The intelligence community, with the aerial photography and satellite image capabilities at
        their disposal (image resolution down to the square centimeter and better in some cases
        and also penetrating radar imagery), have photographs and multiple images that more than
        amply verify my discovery of the structure. By the most sophisticated of space and aerial
        remote sensing methods, this discovery is perhaps the most well verified and
        independently attested discovery of a major archaeological structure in history. It is not
        legitimately classified.
    </p>
    <p style="border: 3px solid purple; ">
        <b>Who controls what citizens are allowed to see and thus allowed to think?</b> Who
        commissions the thought-police? Would it not be absurd to assume that it is but a mere
        coincidence that certain higher resolution civilian satellite images, those catalogued as
        public domain pre-viewable JPEGs (images that include PvB’s discovery site taken
        during specific times of extreme melt), become suddenly unavailable after they have been
        ordered and payment has been sent for them. Were they put up just to find out who would
        order them? Is it plausible that just by coincidence satellite images that include the PvB
        designated site are consistently defective (and therefore not released) or that the ones
        included in the catalogue are only those scenes in which the designated site just happens
        to be cloud and/or snow covered and obscured? It seems hardly likely that embedded
        Lat/Long positions and ortho-rectification should happen to be unavailable for those
        satellite images that include the discovery site. Should one assume then that clear satellite
        images of PvB’s designated discovery site (taken during times of melt) have been
        surreptitiously interdicted? Should one also assume that it was simply for lack of interest
        in that entire region that the higher resolution images showing
        A&gbreve;r&inodot; during the late
        melt periods of 2000, 2001, and 2002, were either just not taken, or not kept. There
        seems to be far too many coincidences.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>But who has verified the discovery? And who has paid the bill?</b> In view of the
        enormity of the structure and the fact that its entire length emerged above the melting ice
        surface in September of 2000, if the Government’s pertinent agencies were to say that
        they cannot provide adequately detailed images of the site without compromising their
        classified remote sensing capabilities, that would not be true. Smaller sections of such
        images can be furnished in JPEG form with sufficient detail and without compromising a
        thing. Furthermore, quite handsomely, we have already paid that bill. (Or, on the other
        hand, what does it cost to cloak and obscure a rainbow, shoot a dove full of birdshot, and
        stomp on the olive leaf in its beak? Can a government purport to stand for freedom and
        peace through truth and honesty and, at the same time, suppresses this discovery?) 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The Turkish Government is fully apprized of this research endeavor and has
        verified my discovery of the ancient ark on Büyük
        A&gbreve;r&inodot;:</b> On September 11, 2001,
        I was at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a conference with the Director of
        Bilateral Cultural Affairs, at their former Tando&gbreve;on offices in Ankara. I had previously
        submitted to them at least the corrected altitude and Lat/Long position of the area and site
        where the structure rests. I had also shown them the structure in the enlargement of the 13
        July 1973 Landsat image. (By then, certain Turkish officials had confirmed the structure
        in that satellite image to be the ancient ark on Büyük
        A&gbreve;r&inodot;). The former Director,
        Ambassador Inkaya, was there. He, in the presence of Ms. Nursel Ustao&gbreve;lu, the new
        Director at that time, told me that it was his place to inform me that a symposium of
        intellectuals had been summoned to review my submissions concerning both the
        discovery of the inscriptions and of the ark. He said that he was to inform me that my
        submissions had been found to be “correct”. It was then that both he and Ms. Ustao!lu
        said that, because of the nature and the significance of these discoveries, I was to
        correspond concerning these matters directly with the Prime Minister. At that moment,
        Ms. Ustao!lu left the room momentarily and returned to say to me, “I regret to inform
        you that the United States is at this moment under terrorist attack, an airplane attack; and,
        because of this, we [meaning Mr. Inkaya and herself] have to go now and attend an urgent
        meeting.”
    </p>
    <p>
        As the perfectly candid (yet diplomatic) language of Mr. Inkaya and Ms. Ustao!lu more
        than implied, the fact that I was to address my correspondence concerning these matters
        directly to the Prime Minister of Turkey meant that the discovery of the ark had not only
        been recognized, but now had international implications which necessarily involved heads
        of government. The directive to divulge these things to me and to require me to
        correspondence directly with the Prime Minister could only have come from the office of
        the Prime Minister. Under these circumstances, I would be expected to understand the
        ramifications. That is, if it was necessary to direct my correspondence to the Prime
        Minister of Turkey, I was obligated to inform the President of the United States
        concerning the disclosures made by the Turkish Government at the 9/11/2001 meeting at
        the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ankara. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What would the present U.S. administration do in the light of the disclosures made
        by the Turkish Government?</b> If the George W. Bush administration were yet to
        continue the policy of the Clinton administration, which was outwardly to ignore but
        actively to suppress both the discovery and the whole research endeavor (which also
        accounted for Mr. Christie’s subsequent course of action), then the Turkish Government
        might as well follow suit, balk, and suppress. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The Project had begun in earnest in 1982 and 1983 with special assistance from both the
        Reagan administration and the Government of Turkey under Prime Minister Özal. It
        seemed only fitting that an acknowledgment of the confirmed discovery of the ancient
        structure on Mt. Ararat should have come out under President George W. Bush’s
        administration. However, to send an unrequested letter to the President of the United
        States is simply to put another envelope on an endless pile and receive a standard and
        inconsequential form letter in response. After my first effort, I knew that I had to use some
        family savvy and Texas style. That is, if I was going to bypass the pile. Since I am the son
        of Willard Nelson Crawford and the town of Crawford, Texas, takes its name from
        Nelson Crawford, a man of our clan, I contacted the editor of the <i>Lone Star Iconoclast</i>,
        Crawford’s hometown newspaper. The editor made sure that the edition containing the
        story about the discovery of the ark, with my letter to the President as a side column on
        the front page (a letter that at least had the Lat/Long position and the altitude of the ark
        correct), was right where it needed to be, and at the right time. When the President came
        in the door of the Crawford Texas White House in the first week of August, 2002, the
        current edition of Crawford’s newspaper lay there on the table to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>In both instances, my letters eventually received replies:</b> in the first instance, from the
        White House’s Secretary of Correspondence; and, in the second, from the Southern
        European Desk of the State Department. Both were about the same. They said “under
        ordinary circumstances” the President cannot endorse such a project. What I was seeking
        was no endorsement per se. For, if any discovery ever stood on its own merits and needed
        no endorsement, this one does. What I was seeking was that the discovery be
        acknowledged so that the research pertaining to it would be expedited rather than
        suppressed, as it had been during the Clinton Administration. As oblivious and
        disinterested as the White House may want to appear, the obstruction and the suppression
        of the discovery has come from the White House through the State Department.
    </p>
    <p style="border: 3px solid purple; ">
        <b>To contemplate an America where the discovery of the ark on Ararat would be
        suppressed is to contemplate an America no longer American.</b> What is protected?
        Only subtle enemies and tyrants operate under the assumption that government ought to
        protect the people from the truth, from freedom, from the freedom of knowing the truth,
        from the consequences of knowing the truth and being free. Such presumptuous dastards
        would feign protect the people from God. Or, whatever the pretense, wouldn’t it have to
        be suppressed if it tended to debunk the Government’s <i>de facto</i> established, tax
        supported, state religion?

    </p>
    <p>
        <b>“And Ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”</b> This is the motto
        of the <b>CIA</b>. To the CIA, Ararat is not sacrosanct. The Agency has released to the public
        aerial photos of Mt. Ararat showing the “Bird’s Eye” and other rocky anomalies that it
        knew were nothing more than rock formations that have nothing to do with the ark. Why?
        In its lingering credibility crises, if that Agency cannot now tell <b>the truth</b> about this
        discovery; frankly, if it is not <b>free</b> to acknowledge the ancient, manmade, rectilinear
        structure at the PvB designated site on Ararat; that would be more than denial, it would be
        betrayal, betrayal both of itself and of the one whom its motto quotes. If suppressed, its
        commitment to truth and freedom would be contradicted. Say aye, CIA.

        <b>No ordinary circumstance:</b> The Project von Bora Discovery Tech-sketch, such as it is,
        has been presented: both to the Republic of Turkey and to United Nations World
        Heritage. It is time there-fore to write to the President once again and send him a signed
        copy of the Tech-sketch. To make a discovery of this kind is not about being first. (Noah
        and family were first.) It is about locating and designating something ancient and
        eminently significant in such a way that it needn’t ever be looked for again, not just so
        that it can be verified, but verified in relation to a recognized and ancient literary source.
        That is what changes the world. Rest assured, neither the President, nor anyone at the
        White House, nor anyone in the present administration—not a single rational soul on the
        Government’s payroll—believes for an instant that this, the confirmed discovery of the
        ancient ark on Ararat, comes “<i>under</i>” the category of “<i>ordinary circumstances</i>”. For both
        White House and State Department to pretend that they regard it as but ordinary when, at
        the same time, both have done such an <i>extraordinary job</i> of suppressing it is no mere
        conundrum. It’s a cannon. When loaded in the way they have loaded it, cannons backfire.
        Their policy with regard to this discovery has neither been in the President’s interest, nor
        in their interest. What a litotes it is to emphasize that it is now in the President’s interest
        to acknowledge this discovery! 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why beat around the bush? Not saying that they won’t now acknowledge it, but if the
        President, the White House, and the administration were instead either to feign
        themselves oblivious to this discovery, or yet to treat it as an “ordinary circumstances”
        unworthy of the President’s attention, this would mean two things: 1, that an honest and
        forthright acknowledgment of the discovery is not forthcoming; and, 2, that the
        administration (and hence the Government) still intends to dissemble and suppress it.
        Though untenable and futile, it would then be a hardened policy. Then, ethics aside,
        whatever would be deemed necessary to suppress the discovery would be done, done to
        the detriment of the Presidency, the Nation, and the World!
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>But why should they want to acknowledge it?</b> Why not? It’s a bit too big to hide!
        History, in its review and grading of a president and an administration’s performance, has
        to take into account that certain circumstances and crises have either been inherited from
        pervious administrations or are simply beyond a president’s and an administration’s
        control. This, however, is quite different. (No other administration has received the
        Project von Bora Discovery Tech-sketch and announcement.) It is indeed an extraordinary
        circumstance, not just because it stands on it own as a discovery that affects everyone in
        the world, but because it is so singular and conspicuous. The enormous structure is either
        there, or it’s not. The verification has been done. Intelligence sources at the
        administration’s disposal are well aware that it is there. Regardless of who or what puts
        pressure on the administration either to deny or to dissemble and suppress this discovery,
        if the President and/or the administration were now to cower, dissemble, and refuse to
        acknowledge it, that would exemplify a depth of depravity and obvious pusillanimity
        perhaps unparalleled in the history of the Nation. So, now that the administration has
        painted itself into a corner with regard to this matter, why should it want to continue to
        paint both itself and the President with that paintbrush? All to camouflage nothing!
        Indelible, it would never wash. History would single it out as an epitomizing faux pas that
        no one could forget. In this matter, there is no deniability to be retained. Is the White
        House to say, “No comment.”? That would be absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
        How about the Turkish Government? Could this be a mutual arrangement? After the
        Turkish Government had made their candid acknowledgment of the discoveries, both of
        the inscription and of the ark, on September 11, 2001, it became obvious that the United
        States Government was not going to follow suit. Rather, the U.S. was outwardly going to
        ignore, but actually going to dissemble and suppress the discovery of the ark. So, what
        then would the Turkish Government be expected to do? Under their defense arrangements
        with the U.S., it would only be expected that the satellite, aerial, and GPS verification of
        the discovery would come by way of United States’ sophisticated remote sensing
        technologies. The Turkish Government, in making the forthright disclosures that they did
        on 9/11/2001, stuck its necks out. Talk about being hung out to dry and to twist in the
        wind! There was really nothing left for them to do but suppress and leave me to be the
        one hung out to dry and dangle in the wind. Not just that, but, if the discovery was
        suppressed, there would be no way to garner the necessary backing and support for such a
        massive and ongoing research endeavor. All the Turkish Government would eventually
        need to do then was require as a condition what the U.S. had shut off.
    </p>
    <p>
        After my first announcement of discovery, the Turkish Government has only done what it
        has deemed appropriate under the circumstances. It gave permission in 1992. Although,
        when David Peterson, Pete Cloe, and I arrived in Turkey, the Ministry refused to
        acknowledge our permit because the Turkish Embassy in Washington had written Giri&scedil;
        and not Ara&scedil;tırma Vizesi, (technical research visa) in our passports. It was pointed out to
        me that I had twice before received an Ara&scedil;tırma Vizesi (’87 and’90) stamped and signed
        in the same passport. That, along with Ziya Mengenecio&gbreve;lu’s fears and uncertainty
        concerning the security situation on the Mountain and the fact that he had teamed up with
        Hussein &Ccedil;oktin, all worked to put the kibosh on that year’s expedition. However, with
        regard to subsequent applications, the Turkish Government’s added requirements at first
        seemed reasonable. I was informed that I needed to work out a joint arrangement with a
        member of an accredited institution in Turkey. That was no problem. Veysel Donbaz,
        Sumerologist for the Archaeological Museums of Istanbul (also a member of the Turkish
        Ministry Culture) and I applied together as a joint endeavor. But then requirements
        changed again. We were to include in our arrangements a research professor, a member
        of the faculty of an internationally recognized university in the United States. From
        Winfield Swanson, the former Managing Editor of Research & Exploration of the
        National Geographic Society, I obtained the name of Prof. Alan R. Gillespie of the
        University of Washington. Alan Gillespie agreed to serve as Research Professor in the
        capacity of critical examiner and U.S. archivist for the research expedition and follow up.
        He would be a most excellent critical examiner because, though he did not doubt that I
        had located a structure on the Mountain, not for one minute did he believe that the
        structure could possibly be the ark. However, as the Glacial Geomorphologist and a
        multi-discipline scientist, he would not jump to any conclusions. Dispassionately, to him
        it is but a matter of what is, is. However, once all three of our names, Donbaz, Gillespie,
        and Crawford, were on the application to the Turkish Government, we found out that the
        requirement had changed once more. Now, a cooperative arrangement had to be worked
        out with the Archaeology Department of Atat&uuml;rk University in Erzurum. Since the
        primary purpose of our proposed fact-finding expedition was to make the discovery
        known so that an ongoing research endeavor could be organized, this should have been no
        problem. But, it turned out that even this could not be accomplished without an added
        condition. I was told that I would have to sign a special contract. However, the contract,
        on its very face, was self-contradictory. Upon closer examination, it was a violation of
        Turkish law. It was an extortive shake-down ploy and gag order not at all in compliance
        with the implementing regulations of the primary Turkish Statute Law that pertains to
        such applications and research. It both added to and contradicted the provisions, the
        mutual protections, and the limitations of that law’s implementing regulations. After
        having affirmed at the Turkish Embassy that I would obey that law and its regulations, if I
        were to sign such an unlawful contract/agreement, whether at the behest of the department
        head of a university or anyone else, I would be in blatant violation of both Turkish Law
        and my prior agreement with the Turkish Government. In fact, to sign and to presume to
        conduct research under such an unlawful agreement could be used as prima facie
        evidence against everyone involved. Although, if used against anyone, it would be used
        against the signer. Though proffered as a condition, no one else would have to own up to
        it. For them, it would simply be called a tentative suggestion under discussion. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I am conversant with knowledgeable Turkish Government officials and educators who
        would never proffer such a contract, let alone require it as a condition. I am also aware of
        capable jurists and competent judges in Turkey who would neither countenance nor in
        anywise tolerate such a flagrant violation and abuse of authority. To sign such a thing
        would be to forfeit their respect and bring reproach on Turkey, on the discovery, and on
        the entire project. But, perhaps this too was to be regard as but a test. Only those who
        “strive lawfully” and tell the whole truth pass the test. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>All this has been a very important test:</b> It should be noted that none of these
        peculiarities and obstructions came up until after the Turkish Government and the United
        States Government knew that I had climbed to the site of the ancient structure and left my
        marker of discovery there. Even though I yet had difficulties with measurement and
        lacked a correct and adequate map for lat/long positioning, agencies of both governments
        were well aware that I had marked the site of the very same 90&deg; cornered, rectilinear
        structure that I had designated in the 13 July 1973 Landsat image.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was only because of opposition and continual obstructions that Scott Tipton (the PvB
        map/survey specialist) and I were not able to be more precise in the rendering of the
        Discovery Tech-sketch. Nevertheless, that site chart is adequate for present purposes.
        Neither the Office of the Prime Minister of Turkey, nor the White House and the present
        administration in Washington D.C. are in any position either to ignore, or deny, or plead
        ignorance with regard to the discovery of the enormous manmade structure at the PvB
        designated site on Greater Mt. Ararat. Nor should either want to. Perhaps they don’t. After
        all, the reality is that the policy of suppression, along with the ice on the Mountain, has
        melted. Such a Chinook change of wind and thaw was inevitable. Meteorologists have
        forecast and are now expecting the hottest summer on record for that region. As the ice
        melts, a whole lot more is bound to be exposed. The question now is, “Who in
        government will pass the test?”
    </p>
    <h2 id="drop" class="anchor">Dropping the Bomb</h2>
    <p>
        <b>The bomb missed the ark, but not by much.</b> It was Dr. Ahmet Ali Arslan’s sister, a long
        time resident of the town of Aralek northeast of the Mountain, who told me about Turkish F16
        fighter aircraft bombing positions high on the north face of the Mountain. Thanks to Clark
        Nelson of SPOT Satellite Image Corporation, I was able to examine a satellite image that
        showed the aftermath of one of those bombing sorties. The SPOT 5 satellite scene (DIMAP
        format, scene PO: 1O718O_O1, ID number 51337OO3O811O81371A/2) shows a bomb crater
        right next to the northeast end of the ancient box vessel. The outside of the crater’s doughnut
        shaped berm is 6O meters in diameter.
    </p>
    <h3>Connecting the Dots</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Bomb explosions have collateral effects:</b> The compression wave of that explosion entered the
        northeast end of the subsurface structure and traversed up the slope all the way through to the
        opposite southwest end of the structure. As the force of the blast exited through portal vents
        and holes in the structure, it left behind readily discernable deposits and disturbances in the ice
        surface. These fresh disturbances, because they were more reflective than the surrounding
        surface, defined the location and rectilinear form of the structure once again. (See explanation
        below.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Confirm this bomb’s collateral effect.</b> The SPOT 5 scene mentioned in the first paragraph
        above should be obtainable from Spot Image Corporation, Chantilly, Virginia. When the
        pertinent sector of that SPOT 5 scene is compared with the contrast PvB POSITION IMAGE
        (shown below on the left) the presence of the subsurface rectangular structure, to the southwest
        of the bomb crater and bearing NE/SW, is readily apparent. (There are two other Spot images
        that were taken on O8/19/O3 which are of interest for orientation purposes.)
    </p>    

    <div id="crater" style="display:inline-block">
        <img src="./assets/vonbora_crater_composite.png" alt="Satellite image of crater" style="float:left">
        <p>
            Explanation: At the top of the outer walls of the
            ancient box/barge vessel, there is a vent opening.
            According to the ancient specifica-tions, the
            opening is one antediluvian cubit (1.17 meters or
            3.8 feet) in height. This vent opening, just under
            the outer edge of vessel’s roof covering, extends
            all the way around the perimeter of the structure
            (see Genesis 6: 16, “in a cubit you shall complete
            it above”.) As the bomb blast surged through the
            entire length of the structure, it exited through the
            vent. (The space under the structure’s roof
            covering would channel the expanding blast.) As
            the blast exited and dissipated, it left behind the
            brighter disturbances. These more reflective
            disturbances occur at almost regular intervals
            along the vent opening at the sides of the
            structure. In the spaces between the structure’s
            outer wall vertical supports these reveal the
            rectilinear form of the manmade structure that is
            immediately under the surface.
        </p>
    
    </div>

    <h2 id="identification" class="anchor">Identification of the Structure</h2>
    <p>
        <b>The ark is to be identified by its location and proportions:</b> As was pointed out in the
        introduction, for anyone to make claims concerning empirical data and artifacts (purportedly
        from the site of the structure) before the site has been formally designated according to the
        correlation of its proportions with the description given in an ancient literary source would be
        wrong procedure. The enormity of the ancient box/barge structure (being the size of a nuclear
        aircraft carrier and with a great deal more volume than any aircraft carrier) and also the nature
        of the ice and glaciation surrounding the structure necessitate that an independent confirmation
        of the structure’s biblical proportions (six to one) be done by aerial photography and radar and
        conventional satellite imagery.
    </p>   
    <p>
        The JPEG of the IKONOS image shows the entire length of the gable of the roof
        superstructure. That image of the structure is congruent with the pattern seen in the PvB
        POSITION IMAGE on the previous page. The latter can be verified by viewing the above
        mentioned SPOT 5 image. The SPOT 5 image clearly shows the bomb crater and the form of
        the rectangular structure to the southwest of the crater. These images are both congruent and
        consistent with the emerging end of the structure seen in the 13 July 1973 LandSat image. All of
        these line up with the perfectly straight and parallel linear side fractures and venting crevasse
        that I photographed as I stood above the structure on the morning of 28 August 1990. I
        approached the structure at that time and left my marker of discovery to designate the site. 
    </p>

    <h2>Independent Confirmation Has Been Done by the Most Sophisticated of Remote Sensing</h2>
    <p>
        Both the Turkish Government and the United States Government have confirmed my discovery
        of the ancient rectilinear structure in the ice between Abich I Glacier and Parrot Glacier on the
        north face of B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; (Greater Mt. Ararat):
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>The United States Government’s verification of my discovery of the structure:</b> On the
        morning of September 26th, 1999, I met with Major General Robert Boots, who was then USAF
        ODC in Ankara and with Major General Philip Nuber USAF rtd. There were others present at
        the United States Air Force base school facility that morning as I gave my report. Maj. Gen.
        Phil Nuber, a previous USAF ODC in Ankara, was then serving as a technical representative
        and consultant for Boeing. He had been in charge of satellite and aerial photo surveillance and
        mapping for the United States Military at the time of my first announcement of the discovery of
        the ancient rectangular structure at Lat. N 39&deg; 42’ 59.7”, Long. 44&deg; 17’ 29.3” on the north face
        of B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; (Greater Mt. Ararat). In the course of my report, 
        I announced how I knew
        that the structure had emerged to appear at the melting ice surface in 1998. When I had
        completed my report at that meeting in Ankara, Gen. Nuber told everyone that all of my
        submissions concerning this discovery had been on his desk. He concurred with my findings
        and my assessment of the July 13, 1973, Landsat image of the structure and nodded to General
        Boots that appropriate action on their part should be taken. Subsequent to that meeting, General
        Nuber told me that I needed a GPS keyed aerial photograph of the site, and he did everything
        that he was allowed to do in order to help this endeavor. His assistances included proofreading
        and approving my letter to General Edip Ba&scedil;er of the Turkish General Staff. 
    </p>
    <p>
        After that morning meeting on base in Ankara, General Boots and his wife took me to lunch at
        the Ankara Hilton. During lunch, General Boots impressed upon me, in no uncertain terms, that
        I must take maximum advantage of the existing situation and press ahead with my work at the
        designated site on the Mountain as soon as possible. It was as if the General somehow knew
        that the ancient structure would again emerge above the melting ice surface in the coming
        summer. It did, as the JPEG of the IKONOS satellite image shows. However, no permit was
        granted by the Turkish Government at that time. 
    </p>
    <p>
        During the week that I met with the Generals, because Ambassador Mark Parris, United States
        Ambassador to Turkey, was away from the Embassy in Ankara, I was asked to meet instead
        with the then Chief of Station, Mr. Eugene Christie. The appointment had been arranged by
        Major General Robert Boots. I gave Mr. Christie a complete summary of the report that I had
        given to the Generals earlier that week, and I included the correct location of the ark. I
        explained how I had confirmed the location of the structure at the site and left my marker of
        discovery there on the morning of August 28, 1990. I knew that he knew that if I were wrong
        about the site, the Generals would never have sent me to report to him.
    </p>
    <p>
        I had noticed a permanent sign affixed to the wall of the Embassy informing those who enter
        that any false statement made in those premises is prosecutable as perjury. At the time, I
        wondered if the sign was intended to apply to civil government officials in the same way it
        applies to ordinary citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Turkish Government’s verification of the discovery: On September 11th , 2001, in the
        office of Bilateral Cultural Affairs of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ankara, the
        Turkish Government acknowledged that all my submissions regarding the discovery of both the
        structure and the Ahora Covenant Inscription were found to be “correct.”
    </p>
    <h3>It’s Time! Let the Truth Come Out.</h3>
    <p>
        If anyone were to assert that the ancient structure is not at the site that I have designated, that
        person either does not know what he is talking about or he is deliberately not telling the truth.
        If there were ever, in the entire history of mankind, a discovery concerning which no one—
        under any pretense whatsoever—should presume to lie, dissemble, or suppress, it would be this
        discovery.
    </p>
    <p>     
        If the United States Government were now either to demur or to deny that it has confirmed my
        discovery of the ancient structure at the designated site on 
        B&uuml;y&uuml;k A&gbreve;r&inodot; Da&gbreve;&inodot; (Greater Mt.
        Ararat), that would be an utterly unjustifiable and inexcusable dishonesty on the part of the
        present administration and several departments. If those who have access to that information
        were to assert that whether or not the presence of the structure at that site on the Mountain has
        been confirmed is a matter that is classified, that would be untrue. It is an archaeological
        structure of more than sufficient size that has emerged above the ice surface and cast its own
        shadow. For these reasons, it is not and cannot be classified. If they were to say that the
        confirmation of the specific form and proportions of the structure is classified, that also would
        be untrue. Or, if they were to say that its Lat/Long position is classified, that too would be
        false. All such Lat/Long positions have been declassified. If they said that they just don’t know,
        that would be a lie. They do know that to refuse to acknowledge the presence of such a
        structure at the site that I have designated would not only be unwarranted, but it would be an
        abuse of authority on the part of any administration or government. 
    </p>
    <h2 id="final" class="anchor">Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        <b>By now, there are but two kinds of people who decry the discovery:</b>
        On the one hand, there are those who, though they have no idea what they are
        talking about, simply do not want it to be true. Even though their doubts were
        resolved, they would more than likely still want it suppressed. On the other hand,
        there are the few who have been privy to the government’s high resolution remote
        sensing images of the site, who, though they have no doubt that the ark is there,
        are yet dissembling and suppressing, or perhaps even disseminating
        disinformation about both discoverer and discovery because of ulterior and false
        motives, or simply because they are afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>A discovery that elicits truth:</b> The storm wind was inevitable: <b>von Bora</b> means
        <i>from the storm wind</i>. To be adrift without an anchor is not about testing the
        waters, or going with the flow, or retaining the approval of men in order to
        achieve some goal. To be without the anchor is to be a lost soul. Mark this
        announcement and these comments; for, especially now that these statements have
        been made public, only an utter fool would lie or dissemble about this discovery.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the broader picture, all the efforts to stymie and obstruct this Project will turn
        out to be futile. Even better, it should soon be apparent that all the opposition
        directed against this Project, the thwarting of the research and the suppression of
        the discovery, even all the things cast in the way that were intended to be
        insurmountable obstacles (which had to be overcome in order to attain and
        substantiate what we now know about the discovery site and about the structure
        itself), all these hindrances have providentially worked for the good of the Project.
        This is the appointed time.

    <h3>Project von Bora Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>
        The Project’s Mission is to make sure that the discovery of the ancient ark on
        Greater Mt. Ararat is known worldwide, that the research which Project von Bora has
        begun on the Mountain is expedited and will continue, and that the information
        pertaining to these things and their implications is published and made accessible to
        all. This website is both the announcement and the letter of information. Of course
        there is more to be said; and, God willing, it will be said.
    </p>
